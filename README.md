## Big Data Analytics Project

In today's business world, it is important for banks to know more about customers who offer services such as credit cards. In other words, having a system that can predict which customers will be able to pay their credit card statements on time would be crucial for bank managers. In this regard, this project is dedicated to performing supervised learning on credit card customer datasets. This dataset contains heterogeneous data (textual, class, numeric) with 23 features. Also, it contains more than 10,000 records that might have missing values. In this project, we will go through all the steps of supervised learning such as preprocessing the data, dividing the data into train and test sets, performing some famous machine learning algorithm (Decision Tree, Random Forest and SVM) and finally, evaluating our models based on the test data.
