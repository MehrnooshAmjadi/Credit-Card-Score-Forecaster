# Credit Card Score Forecaster withSupervised Learning

## Big Data Analytics Project

In today's business world, it is critical for banks to be aware about their customers who receive banks' services such as credit cards, loans and etc. For instance, utilizing some powerful techniques that can predict which customers will be able to pay their credit card statements on time would be crucial for bank managers. In this regard, this project is dedicated to performing supervised learning methods on credit card customer datasets. This dataset contains heterogeneous (tabular, text, categorical, numerical) datasets with missing values. Also, it contains more than 10,000 records categorized in 23 features. In this project, we will go through all the steps of supervised learning such as preprocessing the data, dividing the data into train and test sets, performing some famous machine learning algorithms, such as Decision Tree, Random Forest, SVM and etc. Finally, we will evaluate the models based on the test data.
Moreover we might take advantage of more models or other datasets due to the progress of our project.
